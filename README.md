Game is about a blind person who has to go arround the city and avoid accidents by hearing sounds, and getting vibrations from the enviroment.

Game shows how blind people see. It is a unique experience. How sound is so important to them and makes you feel the fear and the anxiety that they live. Unique playability and mechanics.
